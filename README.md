# Lord of the Rings

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

The app was prepared using `react-create-app`. You can run the app using `npm start` or `yarn start`, which will compile the JS and start a local server.

If you require more info, please refer to the `react-create-app` docs @ https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app.

`react-create-app` supports ES6 syntax.

You are free to use whatever third party libraries or plugins you want, if you feel it is necessary.

You can run `yarn prepare` to install pre-commit library Husky. This will mean all files are linted at commit stage.

## ðŸ“ˆ Goals

- As a user I can see a list of Lord of the Rings characters
- As a user I can filter this list by selecting a category, and see only relevant results
- As a user I can order the list alphabetically by `name` or by the arbitrary `significanceIndex` value
  - `0` is the most important
  - `26` is the least important

In service of these user stories, there are some additional requirements:

- Your solution must have some test coverage
- Your solution must have run prettier
- Your solution must asynchronously load the character list
- Your solution should be styled appropriately (based on design provided)
- The layout at mobile sizes is at your discretion
- Your solution must be compatible with the latest versions of the following browsers:
  - Chrome
  - Safari
  - Firefox
  - Edge

All the assets necessary (including a JSON file with all the required data) are included in the repository.
the extra anonymity - please register a throwaway GitHub account instead of
using your actual GitHub account.
